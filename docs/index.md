When I tell people that I like domino games, they are often surprised to hear
that you can do more than just match the numbers. If you look in a book of
games, often with Mr. Hoyle's name on the cover, you might find the basic game
and maybe All Fives. If you're lucky, you'll find Chickenfoot and Mexican Train.

This is a collection of domino games and puzzles that will broaden your
horizons beyond a chain of dominoes with matching numbers. You'll find new games
and puzzles that I designed, as well as some of my favourite domino games and
puzzles by other designers.

* [Unmatched Donimoes][unmatched-donimoes] is a puzzle I designed
    where you have to slide all the dominoes into a rectangular shape,
    without sliding any matching numbers next to each other. (1 player,
    double-six dominoes)
* [Capturing Donimoes][capturing-donimoes] is a puzzle I designed
    where you have to collect all the dominoes by sliding matching numbers
    next to each other.  (1 player, double-six dominoes)
* [Mirror Donimoes][mirror-donimoes] is a puzzle I designed where
    pawns walk around on top of the dominoes. (1 player, double-six
    dominoes, 4 pawns)
* [Tetradominoes][tetradominoes] is a game I designed where you play
    matching dominoes in a grid, then try to play the tetromino shapes on
    top. (1-4 players, double-six dominoes, 7 cardboard tetrominoes, and
    some beads, buttons, or coins)
* [Bee Donimoes][bee-donimoes] is a puzzle race game I designed where
    a swarm of dice bring nectar back to the hive. (1-6 players,
    double-six dominoes, 3-6 dice, and a timer)
* [Domino Finder][domino-finder] is a memory game I designed where you
    have to find the treasure domino without falling in a trap. (2-4
    players, double-six dominoes, pawns, and two dice)
* [Mountains and Valleys][mountains-and-valleys] is a solitaire game
    by Sid Sackson where you have to lay out a map that you can hike on. I
    added a cooperative version, and adapted it from paper, pencil, and
    dice to use dominoes. (1-4 players, double-six dominoes)
* [Domino Runners][domino-runners] is based on board games by Roland
    Siegers, where your runners run across a grid of dominoes, dropping
    checkers and trying to capture your opponent's checkers. (2 players,
    double-six dominoes, and checkers)
* [Fujisan][fujisan] is a solitaire game by James Droscha where you
    help four Shinto priests climb to the peak of Mount Fuji. I found 20
    layouts that are much more challenging than usual. (1 player,
    double-six dominoes, and four pawns)
* [Cobra Paw][cobra-paw] is a quick-reaction game by Derek Weston.
    (2-4 players, double-six dominoes, and two dice)
* [All Fives][all-fives] is a traditional dominoes game, where you
    score points by making the ends add up to a multiple of five. (2-4
    players, double-six dominoes)
* [Classic Puzzles][classic-puzzles] where you have to lay out
    dominoes in a given pattern to meet some goal, popularized by Henry
    Ernest Dudeney. Also includes Dominosa by O.S. Adler. (1 player,
    double-six dominoes, paper and pencil)
* [Solutions][solutions]

The book of rules includes problems to solve for each puzzle. The Unmatched
Donimoes problems are patterns of dominoes for you to start from, like this:

![Unmatched example]

The Dominosa problems are a pattern of numbers to join into dominoes, like this:

To try the puzzle, get a set of dominoes. Then either [read the rules][rules],
or download [the PDF][pdf].

If you're interested, you can read about [making donimoes] or my
[design journal]. If you're brave, you can read about [experiments] in progress
([PDF][new pdf]).
